# Development Notes and Change Log

## 2025-02-06: Initial Project Setup and MCP Integration

### Major Changes
1. Created the initial project structure with core components:
   - Access Pattern System
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation
   - Model integration layer
   - Prompt management system

2. Implemented MCP core functionality:
   - Added WebSocket-based server and client
   - Implemented tool and resource management
   - Added support for prompt rendering

3. Integrated AI model support:
   - Added Groq model implementation with API integration
   - Added Ollama model for local inference
   - Created base model interface and common functionality

### Design Decisions
1. **MCP Implementation**
   - Chose WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication
   - Implemented JSON-RPC 2.0 message format
   - Added connection tracking for multi-client support

2. **Model Integration**
   - Used mixin pattern for MCP capabilities
   - Standardized tool registration interface
   - Added streaming support for both local and cloud models

3. **Access Patterns**
   - Implemented knowledge graph structure
   - Added pattern composition capabilities
   - Created flexible resource abstraction

### Technical Debt
1. **HTTP Server Setup**
   - Need to implement the HTTP/WebSocket server initialization
   - Add proper error handling for connection failures
   - Implement reconnection logic

2. **Tool Execution**
   - Implement actual tool execution logic
   - Add timeout handling
   - Add result caching

3. **Security**
   - Add authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Implement resource access control
   - Add API key management

### Lessons Learned
1. The Model Context Protocol provides a robust foundation for AI model interaction
2. WebSocket-based communication allows for efficient real-time updates
3. The mixin pattern effectively adds MCP capabilities to existing models

### Next Steps
1. Complete the HTTP server implementation
2. Add more tool implementations
3. Implement authentication and authorization
4. Add monitoring and metrics
5. Create example applications
