# Development Notes and Change Log

## 2025-02-06: Initial Project Setup and MCP Integration

### Major Changes
1. Created the initial project structure with core components:
   - Access Pattern System
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation
   - Model integration layer
   - Prompt management system

2. Implemented MCP core functionality:
   - Added WebSocket-based server and client
   - Implemented tool and resource management
   - Added support for prompt rendering

3. Integrated AI model support:
   - Added Groq model implementation with API integration
   - Added Ollama model for local inference
   - Created base model interface and common functionality

### Design Decisions
1. **MCP Implementation**
   - Chose WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication
   - Implemented JSON-RPC 2.0 message format
   - Added connection tracking for multi-client support

2. **Model Integration**
   - Used mixin pattern for MCP capabilities
   - Standardized tool registration interface
   - Added streaming support for both local and cloud models

3. **Access Patterns**
   - Implemented knowledge graph structure
   - Added pattern composition capabilities
   - Created flexible resource abstraction

### Technical Debt
1. **HTTP Server Setup**
   - Need to implement the HTTP/WebSocket server initialization
   - Add proper error handling for connection failures
   - Implement reconnection logic

2. **Tool Execution**
   - Implement actual tool execution logic
   - Add timeout handling
   - Add result caching

3. **Security**
   - Add authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Implement resource access control
   - Add API key management

### Lessons Learned
1. The Model Context Protocol provides a robust foundation for AI model interaction
2. WebSocket-based communication allows for efficient real-time updates
3. The mixin pattern effectively adds MCP capabilities to existing models

### Next Steps
1. Complete the HTTP server implementation
2. Add more tool implementations
3. Implement authentication and authorization
4. Add monitoring and metrics
5. Create example applications

## 2025-02-07: Major Project Refocus
### Strategic Pivot: From MCP to Advanced LLM Orchestration

#### Key Changes
- Shifted focus from Model Context Protocol to a comprehensive LLM optimization framework
- Introduced multi-agent collaboration system for solution discovery
- Added specialized agent roles: Speed Optimization, Efficiency Enhancement, and Guidance/Context
- Implemented advanced web content extraction capabilities

#### Architectural Decisions
1. **Multi-Agent System**
   - Reason: Enable collaborative problem-solving between specialized LLMs
   - Impact: More sophisticated and optimized solutions through agent specialization
   - Implementation: Distinct agent types with focused responsibilities

2. **Access Pattern Evolution**
   - Previous: Simple protocol-based communication
   - New: Sophisticated solution discovery and optimization pipeline
   - Benefit: Reusable, adaptable patterns that leverage machine-speed operations

3. **Web Content Extraction**
   - Added: Advanced HTML parsing and query capabilities
   - Purpose: Enable LLMs to efficiently extract and utilize web-based information
   - Implementation: HTML-aware query tools (similar to jq for HTML)

#### Technical Debt
1. Need to implement specialized agent interfaces
2. Develop HTML query and extraction tools
3. Create agent collaboration protocol
4. Design pattern storage and retrieval system

#### Next Steps
1. Implement agent specialization framework
2. Develop web content extraction tools
3. Create agent communication protocol
4. Build pattern optimization pipeline

#### Lessons Learned
1. LLMs are most effective when leveraging their unique capabilities rather than mimicking human behavior
2. Multi-agent collaboration produces more robust solutions than single-agent approaches
3. Backend-oriented operations are more efficient than simulated human interactions
