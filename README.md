# Nexus: Advanced LLM Orchestration Framework

## Overview
Nexus is a revolutionary framework that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover and optimize solutions through collaborative reasoning and machine-native operations. Unlike traditional approaches that force LLMs to mimic human behavior, Nexus enables models to leverage their inherent strengths in processing speed, parallel operations, and backend-oriented task execution.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents work together to discover and refine optimal solutions
- **Advanced Web Content Extraction**: HTML-aware query tools for efficient information gathering
- **Access Pattern Optimization**: Reusable, adaptable patterns that capture and improve solution strategies
- **Machine-Native Operations**: Direct backend interactions instead of simulated human behavior
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through collaborative agent feedback

## Architecture
Nexus employs a sophisticated multi-agent system with specialized roles:
1. **Task Execution Agent**: Implements initial solutions
2. **Speed Optimization Agent**: Identifies faster execution methods
3. **Efficiency Enhancement Agent**: Minimizes resource usage
4. **Guidance and Context Agent**: Gathers relevant information and documentation

## Quick Start
```go
// Initialize the Nexus framework
nexus := framework.New()

// Create specialized agents
taskAgent := agents.NewTaskExecutor()
speedAgent := agents.NewSpeedOptimizer()
efficiencyAgent := agents.NewEfficiencyEnhancer()
contextAgent := agents.NewGuidanceProvider()

// Configure collaboration
nexus.AddAgents(taskAgent, speedAgent, efficiencyAgent, contextAgent)

// Execute a task with optimization
result := nexus.ExecuteWithOptimization(task)
```

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/gavinvolpe/nexus
```

## Use Cases
1. **Web Data Extraction**: Efficient gathering of structured data from websites
2. **API Optimization**: Finding the most efficient ways to interact with services
3. **Process Automation**: Creating optimized workflows for complex tasks
4. **Knowledge Discovery**: Uncovering novel insights from diverse data sources

## Why Nexus?
Traditional LLM implementations often force models to mimic human behavior, limiting their potential. Nexus breaks free from this paradigm by:
- Enabling direct backend operations instead of UI simulation
- Leveraging collaborative agent specialization
- Focusing on machine-speed task execution
- Building reusable, optimized access patterns

## Project Status
Nexus is under active development. Current focus areas:
- Implementing specialized agent interfaces
- Developing advanced HTML query tools
- Creating the agent collaboration protocol
- Building the pattern optimization pipeline
