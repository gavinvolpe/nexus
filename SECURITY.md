# Security Policy and Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines security policies, guidelines, and best practices for the Nexus framework. Given the framework's ability to interact with web resources and execute code, security is a critical concern that requires careful attention.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Access Control
- All LLM agents operate with principle of least privilege
- Mentor LLM has restricted access to approved web domains
- Task execution is sandboxed and monitored
- API keys and credentials are managed securely

### 2. Web Interaction Security
#### Rate Limiting
- Implement per-domain request limits
- Respect robots.txt directives
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Monitor and log all web requests

#### Content Safety
- Validate and sanitize all web content
- Implement content filtering
- Scan for malicious patterns
- Enforce MIME type restrictions

#### Request Management
- Use approved HTTP client configurations
- Implement request timeouts
- Follow security headers and policies
- Log all external interactions

### 3. Knowledge Graph Security
#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive pattern data
- Implement access controls on patterns
- Regular security audits of stored data
- Secure backup and recovery procedures

#### Query Safety
- Validate and sanitize all queries
- Implement query timeout limits
- Monitor for unusual query patterns
- Rate limit complex queries

### 4. Code Execution Safety
#### Sandbox Environment
- Isolate code execution
- Resource usage limits
- Network access restrictions
- File system access controls

#### Code Validation
- Static analysis of generated code
- Security pattern checking
- Dependency verification
- Runtime monitoring

### 5. Agent Communication Security
#### Message Integrity
- Encrypt inter-agent communication
- Validate message authenticity
- Implement message signing
- Audit communication logs

#### Access Control
- Role-based access for agents
- Secure credential management
- Session management
- Activity monitoring

## Security Measures by Component

### Web Content Analysis
```go
type SecurityConfig struct {
    // Rate limiting
    RequestsPerMinute  int
    RequestsPerDomain  map[string]int
    BackoffMultiplier  float64
    
    // Content safety
    MaxContentSize     int64
    AllowedMimeTypes   []string
    BlockedPatterns    []string
    
    // Request safety
    Timeout           time.Duration
    AllowedDomains    []string
    RequireHTTPS      bool
}
```

### Knowledge Graph
```go
type SecurityPolicy struct {
    // Access control
    ReadAccess        []string
    WriteAccess       []string
    AdminAccess       []string
    
    // Query safety
    MaxQueryDepth     int
    MaxResultSize     int
    QueryTimeout      time.Duration
    
    // Data protection
    EncryptionKey     []byte
    BackupSchedule    string
    RetentionPeriod   time.Duration
}
```

## Incident Response

### 1. Detection
- Automated monitoring systems
- Anomaly detection
- Security alerts
- User reports

### 2. Response Process
1. Immediate containment
2. Investigation
3. Impact assessment
4. Remediation
5. Recovery
6. Post-incident review

### 3. Reporting
- Document all incidents
- Notify affected parties
- Update security measures
- Implement lessons learned

## Security Updates and Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Security patch schedule
- Dependency updates
- Configuration reviews
- Security testing

### Auditing
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing
- Code reviews
- Compliance checks

## Responsible Disclosure

### Reporting Security Issues
1. Email security@nexus-framework.com
2. Include detailed description
3. Provide reproduction steps
4. Wait for acknowledgment

### Response Timeline
- 24 hours: Initial response
- 72 hours: Investigation update
- 7 days: Mitigation plan
- 30 days: Fix implementation

## Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use environment variables
- Implement key restrictions
- Monitor key usage

### Configuration Security
- Use secure defaults
- Validate all settings
- Implement access controls
- Regular configuration audits

### Deployment Security
- Use secure environments
- Implement firewalls
- Enable logging
- Regular security scans

## Compliance and Standards

### Framework Compliance
- OWASP guidelines
- GDPR requirements
- NIST frameworks
- Industry standards

### Security Certifications
- Regular assessments
- Compliance audits
- Security training
- Documentation updates
