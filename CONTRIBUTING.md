   - Write meaningful commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

3. **Document Your Changes**
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Update COMPONENTS.md for architectural changes
   - Add entries to NOTES.md for significant changes
   - Update API documentation

4. **Test Your Changes**
   - Write unit tests for new functionality
   - Write integration tests for component interactions
   - Ensure all existing tests pass
   - Add benchmarks for performance-critical code

## Coding Standards
